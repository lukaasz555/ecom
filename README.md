## E-com app

[LIVE DEMO](https://lukaasz555-ecom.onrender.com/)

This is a mvp of my e-commerce app, where you can browse products, place an order or view admin panel, where you can see products & orders. My main intention was to check MERN stack, so I also created a [basic api.](https://github.com/lukaasz555/api-ecom)

User is able to filter items by price or categories, add/remove items to/from cart and create order.
You can check [admin panel](https://lukaasz555-ecom.onrender.com/#/admin) as well. There are not many features at the moment, but you can view orders (and sort by date or price) and see all products from store (you can add a new one / edit existing products / remove).

I know there is still a lot to improve and I would appreciate your feedback, so feel free to contact me at:
[hello@lzegar.pl](mailto:hello@lzegar.pl)
#### IMPORTANT
The app is currently hosted @render.com, what can causes some issues with connecting to backend and fetching the products/placing an order. Refreshing the page a few times should help.
I am really sorry about that and I am working on it:(
